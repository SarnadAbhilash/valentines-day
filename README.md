# Valentine's Day Website for Nithya 💖

A playful Valentine's webpage that asks:

**"Nithya, will you be my valentine?"**

- The **No** button keeps moving away so it can't be clicked easily.
- The **Yes** button reveals romantic lines.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Host it for free (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push these files.
2. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - **Source:** `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch:** `main` and `/root`
4. Save and wait about 1–2 minutes.
5. Your site will be live at:
   - `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Alternate free hosting options

- **Netlify:** drag-and-drop this folder at https://app.netlify.com/drop
